## Purpose

This repository contains all of the backpack images found in `tf/tf2_textures_dir.vpk`.

The main purpose of this repository is to provide developers with an easy and efficient way to retrieve backpack images, such as weapons, for their applications or websites.

As such, they've been converted from their original format ( vtf ) and compressed into the webp format, in order to simplify the use and greatly reduce the file size.


## Usage
To make retrieval faster, you can pair this repository with jsdelivr. This will proxy the repository and store it on the edge.

Use the following URL format:

```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tsuza/tf2-backpack-images/$file$
```

Replace `$file$` with the name of the file you need. The repository follows the exact directory hierarchy as it's stored in the game. For example, you could retrieve the path from the item schema and replace `$file$` with it.
